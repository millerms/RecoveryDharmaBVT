## What Is Buddhism?
This is a soft landing for anyone curious about Buddhism, not as a belief system to adopt, but as a practical and ethical path to explore.

These teachings have been deeply meaningful to me in recovery. They helped me reconnect with reality in a clearer, more compassionate way. Buddhist philosophy doesn’t ask for blind faith, it invites investigation, reflection, and presence. That’s what drew me in. It speaks in terms of causes and conditions, suffering and its end, and the possibility of freedom through practice.

Here you’ll find a gentle introduction to core Buddhist ideas, including ethical precepts, the Eightfold Path, and different forms of meditation. The goal isn’t to get it all perfect, it’s to begin with curiosity and keep walking the path. This is especially for folks in recovery who want something grounded, experiential, and not loaded with dogma. Buddhism, at its heart, is a path of liberation through understanding.

If you’re more of a listener or viewer, these two talks offer different but complementary doorways into the heart of practice. One speaks to our deeper sense of identity and belonging, the other to the power of living deliberately and with awareness:

- [Alan Watts: The Real You](https://youtu.be/mMRrCYPxD0I?si=tNn3_KuxT-7LYDHR) - A profound and poetic meditation on self, illusion, and what it means to truly be from the late philosopher Alan Watts.

- [Sam Harris: The Logic of Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vcisHKJ3JA) - A modern, clear-eyed case for meditation as a tool for insight, calm, and transformation from Sam Harris.

## Ethics & Practice

### The Five Precepts

These are voluntary ethical commitments that ground the mind and foster well-being:

1. **To refrain from harming living beings** – Cultivating compassion and nonviolence  
2. **To refrain from taking what is not given** – Honesty and integrity  
3. **To refrain from sexual misconduct** – Respect and mindfulness in relationships  
4. **To refrain from false speech** – Truthfulness, avoiding gossip or harshness  
5. **To refrain from intoxicants that cloud the mind** – Maintaining clarity and mindfulness

In recovery, the **Fifth Precept** resonates deeply. It helps reclaim sobriety as a form of ethical clarity and self-respect. [The Fifth Precept Sangha](https://5th-precept.org/fifth-precept-recovery-community) is a peer-led recovery and meditation community rooted in this ethic.


### The Four Noble Truths & Addiction

1. **There Is Suffering (Dukkha)** – Life involves dissatisfaction in both obvious and subtle forms: suffering, unease, and “not-enoughness.” Addiction often starts as an attempt to relieve this suffering.
2. **Craving (Tanha) Is the Cause** – It is craving—whether physical, emotional, or psychological—that fuels the cycle of addiction.
3. **Cessation of Craving Ends Suffering** – Recovery is possible when we untangle from habitual craving and begin to make space.
4. **The Path Out Is the Eightfold Path** – The way to healing is a holistic, intentional path: wise comprehension, ethical living, mindful presence, and steady effort.

**Recovery Dharma** adapts these as:
- Addiction causes suffering  
- Craving creates addiction  
- Recovery is possible  
- The Eightfold Path is our guide

### The Eightfold Path

A blueprint for living wisely and compassionately, divided into three domains:

**Wisdom (Paññā)**  
- Right View – Seeing clearly that craving causes suffering  
- Right Intention – Commitment to renunciation, harmlessness, and compassion

**Ethics (Sīla)**  
- Right Speech – Truthful, kind, and useful communication  
- Right Action – Behaving ethically, guided by the precepts  
- Right Livelihood – Earning a living without harm

**Mental Training (Samādhi)**  
- Right Effort – Cultivating wholesome states of mind  
- Right Mindfulness – Clear awareness of body, feelings, thoughts  
- Right Concentration – Deep states of calm through meditation
