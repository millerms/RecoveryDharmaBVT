## For Local Development
A reproducible, low-maintenance setup for each new project:
```bash
cd my-new-site
rbenv local 3.2.2
echo "3.2.2" > .ruby-version
exec "$SHELL"
gem install bundler
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Repository Hygiene
To keep this repo clean and focused on source content:

- Do **not** commit the `_site/` folder â€” it is generated by Jekyll.
- Avoid committing temporary files like `.sass-cache/`, `.jekyll-cache/`, or ZIP archives.
- Use a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary or generated files.

Example `.gitignore`:
```gitignore
_site/
.sass-cache/
.jekyll-cache/
*.zip
*.log
.DS_Store
